                <p> My first ever video game was Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit
                    for the Playstation. If I remember correctly, I was around the
                    age of three years old. This console spawned tons of classic games that
                    I still play to this day. My absolute favorites are the Crash Bandicoot,
                    Spyro, and Need for Speed series.

                <h2>Xbox 360</h2>

                <p> The first console that was truly all mine was my Xbox 360.
                    The new generations of consoles were launching and it was time
                    to upgrade from my Playstation 2. I asked my dad if I could get
                    a new console for christmas. My options were to either wait for
                    the Playstation 3 to release (would arrive next year), or to go
                    ahead and ask for the Xbox 360. I decided to go with the latter.
                    And one of the games I recieved with it was the incredible Call of
                    Duty 2 (long before the series went downhill). It turned me into
                    a massive World War II fanatic. I loved learning about the events
                    of the war. As I grew older, I started wanting to get more mature
                    games. The first M game I was allowed to play (key word allowed,
                    I used to sneak onto Grand Theft Auto on our Playstation 2) was
                    Halo 3. My dad quickly saw that the game didnt deserve its M rating
                    (rated M for mature) and allowed me to buy it after renting.
                    This quickly lead me into the deep in, and my second M rated game
                    was Gears of War. This game was known for its intense gore and 
                    violence, especially its body dismemberment animations.
                    This console is what sucked me into having gaming as my number
                    one hobby.

                <h2>Xbox One</h2>
                <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Microsoft-Xbox-One-Console-Set-wKinect.jpg/1200px-Microsoft-Xbox-One-Console-Set-wKinect.jpg" alt="Xbox One">
                <br>
                <p> The infamous Xbox One. Known for its exclusive game catalog being
                    and disappointing for titles that were exclusive. Despite these issues,
                    it ended up becoming my console of choice. The redesigned controller
                    was far superior to both the older model, and to its competitors.
                    I have poured more money into my collection of games for this console
                    than I have for any of my previous consoles. Currently, my game library
                    stands somewhere around the 250+ range.

                <h2>Playstation 4</h2>

                <br>
                <p> This was the first game console that I personally purchased.
                    I stood around in the store for about two and a half hours before
                    deciding to buy it. The issue holding me back was that I was about
                    to spend $400 on a console to play ONE GAME. I bought this console
                    just to play ONE GAME. And that game still holds legendary status,
                    even after its release 5 years ago. This game is Naughty Dog's
                    absolute masterpiece: The Last of Us. Looking back on my purchase,
                    I still have no regrets. I even have already purchased the beefed
                    up version of the Playstation 4, known as the Playstation 4 PRO. I
                    need to make sure I can play the sequel in the best quality possible.
                    I can't wait for its release.

                <h2>Xbox One X</h2>
                <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B57DQW8TF3B8HwWJXnoSEX-480-80.jpg" alt="Xbox One X Scorpio Edition">
                <br>
                <p> The most powerful console EVER. I just had to have it. I had been following
                    its progress over 2 years before its launch and official reveal. I even bought
                    a whole new, top of the line tv from samsung for way too much money. But running
                    all of these games in 4K resolution with stunning HDR visuals makes it all worth it.
                    I watched eagerly during the reveal livestream. When they announced the limited
                    edition in honor of its code name "Project Scorpio", I snatched that up before it
                    quickly went out of stock. This absolute powerhouse is still my console of choice
                    to this day, and I absolutely love it.
